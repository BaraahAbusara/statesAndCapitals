# statesAndCapitals

For this task I'll be using Java Streams, Collections, and lambda functions to figure out some state trivia.   
For this lab I am only asked to make some tasks pass as told in the [task requirements](./README-TASK.md). 

To run my code and see the output, the results of my tests are printed at the end of testStatesAndCapitals() inside StatesAndCapitalsTest file with "System.out.println(testResults);".  
"true" means a test is passing, while "false" means it is failing.  
I am asked to solve 19 task in minimum, order is not required.
